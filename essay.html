   <h1>Essay 2</h1>
   <p>
    Designers and developers are responsible for creating digital experiences that impact our daily lives. Their choices in UI and UX design can either improve or hinder the user’s experience. There are some great and bad examples of these principles being kept and not adhered to. In the essay, I will be exploring the ethics of UI/UX design through the lends of the Stats SA website, 
    examining the choices and made and how they align with the principles of functional and socially responsible design.<br>

    Statistics South Africa is one of the main sources of statistical information regarding the country. These range from population censuses to economic surveys that might be of good use to policymakers, researchers, businesses, and the general public. You can select the stats on the site based on the theme. Now to describe the actual website, it has a modern design with a mostly white background and blue accents. The Stats SA logo is displayed on the left of the header section, with a navigation menu being on the right. This gives easy access to the different explorable sections of the site, like the census, surveys and Data. There is also some things on news, publications, and a contact tab. Right below this, there is a very prominent search bar to find more specific information. Having made a descriptive detailing of the website, we can now look at the ethics of these design choices. “Ethics in web design refers to the moral principal and values that govern the behavior of designers and developers as they create, maintain and improve websites and web applications”, a quote from Elizabeth Volbeda, Web Design: The Future is Now. She argues that design choices should consider the impact they have on users, society and the environment they’re used in.

    In his piece “Design of the Real World”, Victor Papanek argues that design must be revolutionary and radical if it is to be considered socially responsible. He argues that the main focus on design should just be for the aesthetic look, but also the social impact said design has. This varies from designing more sustainable an accessible systems/product for people of different backgrounds and contexts. With this in mind, we can turn our attention back to the Stats SA website. It has been designed to provide easy access to statistical information about the country to different users and could relate to their own industries. It’s designed with the public and researchers who rely on stats. He also spoke on radical shift from the norm. Similarly, the Stats SA site departs from the norm, not using complex spreadsheets and tables, but representing the data in a visually appealing and easy-to-read way. James Gibson, in “Alternative Approaches to Interface” has a similar view to Papanek. “Interfaces should be designed to fit the user’s perception and action capabilities”. This approach references the importance of the users’ perception and action capabilities when designing their interfaces. The Stats SA has similarly been designed to make for a user-friendly and intuitive interface.

    Having looked at the design and the importance of functional and socially responsible design pf the site, the next main thing to look at is the context and conventions of the stats and site. In “Convention and Context”, Steven Mallioux explores the relationship between the conventions of a literary text and the context it is interpreted and produced. According to Mailloux’s theory, ‘conventions are the established, structure, genre and patterns of language that govern the creation of literary texts’, while the context relates to the ‘historical, social and cultural conditions that shape their production (1983, p1). Similarly, the site is designed to fit the users’ existing knowledge and experience. The navigation menu being at the top of the site, and usage of a search bar for example. These were design choices matching the conventions of other sites. Gibson also speaks on feedback (interaction with the sites’ interface giving clear feedback to the user, by highlighting menus), consistency (simple usage of the same font and color scheme throughout the site). And lastly, the idea of natural mapping throughout a design. For example, there is icons used to categories different information, such as “data” and “survey”. These icons are used to clearly represent the functionality of these interface objects. The “survey” icon for instance uses an image of a survey form and a “magnifying glass” in the search bar.

    There are also some other South African websites that haven’t been as successful as the Statistics SA website however. For one, the SASSA (South African Social Security Agency) website. Some of the design choices on it do not align with Gibson’s approach to interaction design. The icons representing different functions aren’t as intuitive as the Stats SA site, lacking a level of natural mapping. This could lead to frustration and confusion with its usage. The website also didn’t seem to account for the social responsibility of making the website easily accessible and consistent on different devices. Some information on the website is displayed with vague titles. For example, instead of titling links to different pages on the statistics page in a more consistent manner, it’ll go from “May 2022 report” to “FACTSHEET June 2022”. Someone who has to check the site regularly will this. The website has also been criticized for its lack of accessibility for people with visual impairments. There aren’t alternative texts for descriptions of images, making it difficult for people using screen readers to understand images content. There is also lack for keyboard accessibility around the site. These choices go against Papanek’s idea of design being socially responsible by accounting for diverse users and devices.
    <br>
    </p>

    <p>
    In conclusion, the Stats SA website has been designed with the user in mind, aiming to provide easy access to information in a user friendly and visually appealing way with design choices aligning to the principles of functional and socially responsible design.
