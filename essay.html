          Designers and developers are responsible for creating digital experiences that impact our daily lives. Their choices in UI and UX design can either improve or hinder the user’s experience. There are some great and bad examples of these principles being kept and not adhered to. In the essay, I will be exploring the ethics of UI/UX design through the lens of the Stats SA website, examining the choices made and how they align with the principles of functional and socially responsible design.

          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Statistics South Africa is one of the main sources of statistical information regarding the country. These range from population censuses to economic surveys that might be of good use to policymakers, researchers, businesses, and the general public. You can select the stats on the site based on the theme. Now to describe the actual website, it has a modern design with a mostly white background and blue accents. The Stats SA logo is displayed on the left of the header section, with a navigation menu being on the right. This gives easy access to the different explorable sections of the site, like the census, surveys, and data. There are also sections for news, publications, and a contact tab. Right below this, there is a very prominent search bar to find more specific information. Having made a descriptive detailing of the website, we can now look at the ethics of these design choices. "Ethics in web design refers to the moral principal and values that govern the behavior of designers and developers as they create, maintain, and improve websites and web applications", a quote from Elizabeth Volbeda, Web Design: The Future is Now. She argues that design choices should consider the impact they have on users, society, and the environment they are used in.

          <h2>Ethics of UI/UX Design</h2>
          <p>
            In his piece "Design of the Real World," Victor Papanek argues that design must be revolutionary and radical if it is to be considered socially responsible. He argues that the main focus on design should not just be for the aesthetic look but also the social impact said design has. This varies from designing more sustainable and accessible systems/products for people of different backgrounds and contexts. With this in mind, we can turn our attention back to the Stats SA website. It has been designed to provide easy access to statistical information about the country to different users and could relate to their industries. It’s designed with the public and researchers who rely on stats. He also spoke on a radical shift from the norm. Similarly, the Stats SA site departs from the norm, not using complex spreadsheets and tables but representing the data in a visually appealing and easy-to-read way. James Gibson, in "Alternative Approaches to Interface," has a similar view to Papanek. "Interfaces should be designed to fit the user's perception and action capabilities." This approach references the importance of the users' perception and action capabilities when designing their interfaces. The Stats SA site has similarly been designed to make for a user-friendly and intuitive interface.

          <h2>Context and Conventions</h2>
          <p>
            Having looked at the design and the importance of functional and socially responsible design of the site, the next main thing to look at is the context and conventions of the stats and the site. In "Convention and Context," Steven Mallioux explores the relationship between the conventions of a literary text and the context in which it is interpreted and produced. According to Mailloux's theory, "conventions are the established structure, genre, and patterns of language that govern the creation of literary texts," while the context relates to the "historical, social, and cultural conditions that shape their production" (1983, p1). Similarly, the site is designed to fit the users' existing knowledge and experience. The navigation menu is at the top of the site, and the usage of a search bar, for example. These were design choices matching the conventions of other sites. Gibson also speaks on feedback (interaction with the site's interface giving clear feedback to the user, by highlighting menus), consistency (simple usage of the same font and color scheme throughout the site). And lastly, the idea of natural mapping throughout a design. For example, there are icons used to categorize different information, such as "data" and "survey." These icons are used to clearly represent the functionality of these interface objects. The "survey" icon, for instance, uses an image of a survey form and a "magnifying glass" in the search bar.

          <h2>Comparison with Other Websites</h2>
          <p>
            There are also some other South African websites that haven't been as successful as the Statistics SA website, however. For one, the SASSA (South African Social Security Agency) website. Some of the design choices on it do not align with Gibson's approach to interaction design. The icons representing different functions aren't as intuitive as the Stats SA site, lacking a level of natural mapping. This could lead to frustration and confusion with its usage. The website also didn't seem to account for the social responsibility of making the website easily accessible and consistent on different devices. Some information on the website is displayed with vague titles. For example, instead of titling links to different pages on the statistics page in a more consistent manner, it goes from "May 2022 report" to "FACTSHEET June 2022." Someone who has to check the site regularly will find this confusing. The website has also been criticized for its lack of accessibility for people with visual impairments. There aren't alternative texts for descriptions of images, making it difficult for people using screen readers to navigate and understand the content.

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            In conclusion, the design of the Stats SA website aligns with the principles of functional and socially responsible design. It provides easy access to statistical information, represents data in a visually appealing way, and has a user-friendly interface. The design choices consider the users' perception and action capabilities and match the conventions of other websites. In comparison, other South African websites like SASSA's website lack intuitive icons, consistency, and accessibility features, which hinders the user experience. By examining the ethics of UI/UX design through the lens of the Stats SA website, it becomes clear that design choices can greatly impact the user experience and the social responsibility of a website. It's important for designers and developers to consider the impact their choices have on users, society, and the environment in which they are used.
