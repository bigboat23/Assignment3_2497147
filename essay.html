          Designers and developers are responsible for creating digital experiences that impact our daily lives. Their choices in UI and UX design can either improve or hinder the user’s experience. There are some great and bad examples of these principles being kept and not adhered to. In the essay, I will be exploring the ethics of UI/UX design through the lens of the Stats SA website, examining the choices made and how they align with the principles of functional and socially responsible design.
        </p>

          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Statistics South Africa is one of the main sources of statistical information regarding the country. These range from population censuses to economic surveys that might be of good use to policymakers, researchers, businesses, and the general public. You can select the stats on the site based on the theme. Now to describe the actual website, it has a modern design with a mostly white background and blue accents. The Stats SA logo is displayed on the left of the header section, with a navigation menu being on the right. This gives easy access to the different explorable sections of the site, like the census, surveys, and data. There are also sections for news, publications, and a contact tab. Right below this, there is a very prominent search bar to find more specific information. Having made a descriptive detailing of the website, we can now look at the ethics of these design choices. "Ethics in web design refers to the moral principal and values that govern the behavior of designers and developers as they create, maintain, and improve websites and web applications", a quote from Elizabeth Volbeda, Web Design: The Future is Now. She argues that design choices should consider the impact they have on users, society, and the environment they are used in.

          <h2>Ethics of UI/UX Design</h2>
          <p>
            In his piece "Design of the Real World," Victor Papanek argues that design must be revolutionary and radical if it is to be considered socially responsible. He argues that the main focus on design should not just be for the aesthetic look but also the social impact said design has. This varies from designing more sustainable and accessible systems/products for people of different backgrounds and contexts. With this in mind, we can turn our attention back to the Stats SA website. It has been designed to provide easy access to statistical information about the country to different users and could relate to their industries. It’s designed with the public and researchers who rely on stats. He also spoke on a radical shift from the norm. Similarly, the Stats SA site departs from the norm, not using complex spreadsheets and tables but representing the data in a visually appealing and easy-to-read way. James Gibson, in "Alternative Approaches to Interface," has a similar view to Papanek. "Interfaces should be designed to fit the user's perception and action capabilities." This approach references the importance of the users' perception and action capabilities when designing their interfaces. The Stats SA site has similarly been designed to make for a user-friendly and intuitive interface.

          <h2>Context and Conventions</h2>
          <p>
            Having looked at the design and the importance of functional and socially responsible design of the site, the next main thing to look at is the context and conventions of the stats and the site. In "Convention and Context," Steven Mallioux explores the relationship between the conventions of a literary text and the context in which it is interpreted and produced. According to Mailloux's theory, "conventions are the established structure, genre, and patterns of language that govern the creation of literary texts," while the context relates to the "historical, social, and cultural conditions that shape their production" (1983, p1). Similarly, the site is designed to fit the users' existing knowledge and experience. The navigation menu is at the top of the site, and the usage of a search bar, for example. These were design choices matching the conventions of other sites. Gibson also speaks on feedback (interaction with the site's interface giving clear feedback to the user, by highlighting menus), consistency (simple usage of the same font and color scheme throughout the site). And lastly, the idea of natural mapping throughout a design. For example, there are icons used to categorize different information, such as "data" and "survey." These icons are used to clearly represent the functionality of these interface objects. The "survey" icon, for instance, uses an image of a survey form and a "magnifying glass" in the search bar.

          <h2>Comparison with Other Websites</h2>
          <p>
            There are also some other South African websites that haven't been as successful as the Statistics SA website, however. For one, the SASSA (South African Social Security Agency) website. Some of the design choices on it do not align with Gibson's approach to interaction design. The icons representing different functions aren't as intuitive as the Stats SA site, lacking a level of natural mapping. This could lead to frustration and confusion with its usage. The website also didn't seem to account for the social responsibility of making the website easily accessible and consistent on different devices. Some information on the website is displayed with vague titles. For example, instead of titling links to different pages on the statistics page in a more consistent manner, it goes from "May 2022 report" to "FACTSHEET June 2022." Someone who has to check the site regularly will find this confusing. The website has also been criticized for its lack of accessibility for people with visual impairments. There aren't alternative texts for descriptions of images, making it difficult for people using screen readers to navigate and understand the content.

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            In conclusion, the design of the Stats SA website aligns with the principles of functional and socially responsible design. It provides easy access to statistical information, represents data in a visually appealing way, and has a user-friendly interface. The design choices consider the users' perception and action capabilities and match the conventions of other websites. In comparison, other South African websites like SASSA's website lack intuitive icons, consistency, and accessibility features, which hinders the user experience. By examining the ethics of UI/UX design through the lens of the Stats SA website, it becomes clear that design choices can greatly impact the user experience and the social responsibility of a website. It's important for designers and developers to consider the impact their choices have on users, society, and the environment in which they are used.

          The concept of AI represents a transformative technological advancement with profound implications for production in various industries. Task automation is Described as a fundamental risk, the holy grail, and the greatest discovery since fire by some of the most influential people in tech. A great tool for businesses, especially with AI-driven solutions allowing for the gain in operational efficiency and new avenues of growth. A system capable of learning and adapting in real-time brings the opportunity for companies to streamline processes, reduce costs, and accelerate innovation.

          Despite some of its many great advantages, however, like with any new technology, there are some risks and issues that come with it all at the same time. On Tuesday May 30th, over 300 industry leaders, including figures in AI research, academia, and technology, signed a document outlining the risks of AI. The document named the ‘Statement on AI Risk' (2023) was released by the Center for AI Safety (CAIS). The aptly named statement reads “Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war.” The risk in question is described by the CAIS as a potentially existential threat that should be taken seriously on par with nuclear war and pandemics. They’ve emphasized that the risks related to AI could lead to the overall extinction of humans. Quite a bold claim. In the essay, I will be looking at the impact of algorithmic culture on the ethical dimensions of content curation, user privacy, and the potential of our extinction as we know it. 
        </p>
        </section>
        <p>
          The release of the statement serves as a pivotal step in raising awareness about the risks and potential dangers associated with AI. A risk so big it seems, is being put on the same level as nuclear wars, pandemics, and other worldwide societal-scale risks. The statement underscores the importance of research in understanding and addressing these risks it comes with. By advocating for increase increased research to understand the risks, which can inform the further development of mitigation strategies. Furthermore, the statement calls for the creation of policy to govern the usage, and various principles or regulations proposed. 
        </p>
        <section>
          <p>
          I’ve already spoken about what the statement is and the reason why it’s been made, I’m yet to speak about the risks in detail. I started by speaking about the advantages of automation for digital businesses. The reason for this is that I instantly thought about the statement concerning internet ethics on the side of business and content consumption, from the point of view of an artist.

          I spoke a little about AI algorithms curating the “perfect piece” of content for a user. These algorithms learn from the user’s likes and dislikes, then display the correct content on their feed. The more users and the more you use the app, it constantly gets better. For example, if you were to start watching video essays about certain topics on YouTube (game reviews, for example), your feed will slowly over time get populated by similar videos. But it won’t just randomly display these videos based on that, but also your subscriptions and what people who watch those specific creators have been interested in. Google will also similarly use its external ad systems to target ads to your feed based on a similar algorithmic process. I noticed this, while I was looking for a lens for my mirrorless camera. As much as this is good for content curation, it impacts the user’s privacy. This raises a greater question on user data manipulation. Huge Tech companies have too much control of data in their hands and it being connected with algorithmic processing, means even greater control and the ability to manipulate user data is gained. In, The Internet as a Moral Space: The Legacy of Roger Silverstone (2007), Orgard states that "Analyses of the internet often overlook the moral status of online communications and the sustenance of responsibility towards mediated others." This highlights the need to consider the ethical dimensions of online interactions and the responsibility that tech companies hold toward their users. The concentration of power on the higher scale should also come with a sense of accountability and responsibility towards the users. The Cambridge Analytica scandal could be viewed as an example of the data being misused, also highlighting the ethical implications (2022).

          These dangers however are only minor in some other issues, like automation leading to job loss, algorithmic surveillance, and decreased user agency for example. I hadn’t started or done any actual critique of the statement. I feel like the statement’s approach of placing this on the scale of pandemics and nuclear wars is a bit too exaggerated. It is quite essential to assess the risks on a proportional scale. So far at least, AI development has been much more of a valuable asset than an existential threat. Safeguards and guidelines would be better implemented to be able to have more control of the risks.

          I certainly agree, that regulations and more governance on the usage of AI algorithms should be more of a common house. This allows for artists to not have their artwork stolen but also for overall safety on the side of users. But there has to be a line between impacting innovation and regulation. One example perhaps, is the debate surrounding net neutrality. This concept ensures the equal treatment of all internet traffic by ISPs, without discrimination. With this context, net neutrality ensures equal treatment of the traffic, which is essential for AI technologies to be further developed. If the regulations in this area are relaxed, this allows the ISPs to prioritize certain content, equally stifling development in the field and further increasing the need for more accountability on the side of huge companies. Relaxing regulations potentially limit the development and deployment of AI technologies, which aligns with Orgard's emphasis on the moral status of online communications. There have also not yet been any signs, pointing towards our extinction with further developments in technology. It is indeed crucial to acknowledge speculative scenarios and hypothetical risks, but it is also quite important to base these on empirical evidence. This currently seems like the usual panic that comes with a major advancement in technology, that has the potential to change how humans operate and view the world. The major worry here, and rightfully so, is the loss of jobs on a great scale with automation. But at the same time, there are new jobs that will be created within different industries, as a result of automation. backup by the World Economic Forum (2023).

         <p>
          In conclusion, while it is crucial to acknowledge and address the potential risks and ethical considerations associated with AI, the notion of AI leading to human extinction on a global level seems a bit exaggerated. By implementing safeguards, responsible governance, and regulations, we can take full advantage of AI while minimizing the likelihood of catastrophic outcomes, enabling us to embrace the transformative power it brings with great confidence.
